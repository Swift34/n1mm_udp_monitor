N1MM+ can send out UDP packets to provide information to remote systems like a Contest Dashboard for a Multi-Station. The details about the xml that are sent can be found here: https://n1mmwp.hamdocs.com/mmfiles/udp_external_udp_broadcasts-xml/

To run you need a properly installed python3 instance then you run with:

python n1mm_udp_monitor.py
